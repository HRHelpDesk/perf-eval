00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,270
Welcome to preventing workplace gossip and other disruptive behavior. 

2
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,200
My name is Lisa Smith, and I will be your trainer 

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:22,920
today. 

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,500
This course has two sections of information in section one, 

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:34,560
we will discuss confidentiality in the workplace gossip, rumors and 

6
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,210
personal information. 

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,580
So let's start out by asking the question, what is 

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,380
gossip Well, some people think that gossiping is like secret 

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,040
telling, you know, sometimes it's considered to be fun and 

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,940
interesting, and some people get a real ego boost by 

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,310
being included in a chain of gossip. 

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,910
Some people like being the topic of gossip. 

13
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:06,240
Again, another ego boost that gossip can be very, very 

14
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,290
hurtful. 

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,180
Gossip can include things like rumors or unconfirmed reports attacks 

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,270
on someone's personality and character, negative belittling or humiliating. 

17
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,470
Talk about a peer intended to undermine them. 

18
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,500
And gossip can also be factual, shared information that could 

19
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,460
be confidential. 

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,570
There is a term that's often used in pop culture 

21
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,940
today called hot Goss. 

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,770
This is a popular term and is sometimes viewed as 

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,150
a social commodity. 

24
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,650
You know, the person with the hottest Goss wins, but 

25
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,680
ask yourself in your experience, does anyone really win When 

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,050
gossip becomes the order of the day, sometimes gossip is 

27
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,800
intentionally meant to harm someone, but on the other hand, 

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,230
some people don't even realize they're gossiping. 

29
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,970
They think they're just having a casual conversation about another 

30
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,570
person about something that is none of their business. 

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,240
Gossip can even be positive information that's being relayed, but 

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,140
it's still gossip. 

33
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,400
And quite often even positive information in a gossip session 

34
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,200
turns into something negative. 

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,380
So ask yourself, have you ever been the target of 

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,660
workplace gossip And if so, how did it make you 

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,150
feel This is a great place to stop the video. 

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,000
And if you're in a group discuss amongst yourselves, what 

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,020
that felt like if you're comfortable even take a minute 

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,060
to relay your experience, share with the crowd, because this 

41
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,510
is information that we really want to dive into, and 

42
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,960
we don't want to make light of, if you're viewing 

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,930
this alone, you can still stop the video for a 

44
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,370
minute and just think about it. 

45
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,700
And then when you're ready, click it back and move 

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,270
forward. 

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,700
How rumors get started. 

48
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,600
Well, my dad used to always have the saying that's 

49
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,320
how rumors get started when you would misunderstand something that 

50
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,830
was said about someone or even maybe about yourself. 

51
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,400
So how to misunderstandings actually happen Well, they can happen 

52
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,660
a lot of different ways. 

53
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,700
And one, one small misunderstanding can turn into fodder for 

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,550
rumors, which can devolve into a wildfire of gossip. 

55
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,150
The best way to limit the damage of a wildfire 

56
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,420
is to make sure the environment is not wildfire friendly. 

57
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,460
So clear communication is a necessity for creating a fire 

58
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,590
retardant working environment. 

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,130
So ask yourself, how do misunderstandings happen Have you ever 

60
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:15,370
been the victim or the target or the unknowing participants 

61
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,050
of the misunderstanding I know that you've all heard of 

62
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,860
the game telephone, right And so this is a game 

63
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,600
that is often played with kids to help them understand 

64
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,570
how a rumor can get started or how you can 

65
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,050
hear one thing and repeat it so many times that 

66
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,800
by the time it gets down the line, the entire 

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,300
original message has been distorted into something that doesn't even 

68
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,940
look like what the original message was. 

69
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,240
So this is an exercise that again, if you're in 

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,450
a group setting, it would be great time to stop 

71
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,210
the video and go through the exercise. 

72
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,930
So at the beginning of the game, the first person 

73
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,720
is going to whisper a sentence into the next person's 

74
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,080
ear. 

75
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,550
You can decide whatever that is. 

76
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,060
It can be pre-planned by your facilitator, or, you know, 

77
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,670
you can just make something up during the game. 

78
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,360
Each player will whisper the sentence into the next person's 

79
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,120
ear until it reaches the last player in line. 

80
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,470
At the end of the game, the last player says 

81
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,530
the sentence out loud so that everyone can hear how 

82
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,590
much it has changed from the first whisper at the 

83
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,520
beginning of the circle or the line rules for the 

84
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,000
telephone game, the word or phrase can only be whispered 

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,630
once. 

86
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,270
So players must pay close attention. 

87
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,140
The word or phrase should never be too familiar. 

88
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,440
You want to make sure it changes as it's whispered. 

89
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,500
So if you say something like it is what it 

90
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,040
is. 

91
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,580
Everyone's heard that 10,000 times, and that's going to be 

92
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,810
pretty clear that if you say something that is different 

93
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,020
and is not a catch or not something usual, then 

94
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,520
it has a better chance of actually simulating the transfer 

95
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,210
of gossip. 

96
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,810
And then finally, only one player. 

97
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,260
The first player should know what the word or phrase 

98
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:12,860
is. 

99
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,530
The facilitator of the game may wish to have the 

100
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,130
original phrase or word written down so that at the 

101
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,720
very end we can corroborate what it actually was with 

102
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,980
what that final player believes he or she heard. 

103
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:28,820
Okay. 

104
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,910
So click, pause, and get started. 

105
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,960
I hope you enjoyed the telephone game. 

106
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,810
And if you are viewing this alone, play it at 

107
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,860
home with some family members or friends, and it's a, 

108
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,530
it can be a really good time and also a 

109
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,800
great teaching tool for yourself and for your family members, 

110
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,940
understanding the red flags of workplace gossip versus harmless venting. 

111
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,680
You know, sometimes we just need to vent and sometimes 

112
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,660
we're venting about someone else. 

113
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,250
And sometimes that's okay because we don't need to bottle 

114
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,980
things up and suppress them to the point to where 

115
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,960
we're anxious and depressed. 

116
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,820
And we dread coming to work every day. 

117
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,200
No, of course not. 

118
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,960
But there is a time and a place and an 

119
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,010
appropriate chain of command for expressing your events. 

120
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,810
So keep that in mind, John, the head manager of 

121
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,430
Acme was giving a presentation about a new product launching 

122
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,270
next week. 

123
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,980
During this meeting, Mandy kept interrupting the meeting, complaining about 

124
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,220
how he's not giving them enough time to prepare to 

125
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,040
launch and how it's going to fail. 

126
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,720
John had to ask Mandy three times to stop interrupting. 

127
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,480
Now let's look at what a red flag might look 

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,810
like. 

129
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,440
John starts talking about Mandy. 

130
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,430
When she leaves the meeting stating how rudely she behaved. 

131
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,390
John then starts complaining about what has happened at past 

132
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,030
meetings and company get togethers. 

133
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,250
That would be a red flag for gossip, as opposed 

134
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,750
to harmless venting, which might be when Mandy leaves the 

135
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,410
office. 

136
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,160
John states, that he cannot believe she interrupted him three 

137
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,910
times. 

138
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,680
He doesn't make any accusations about Mandy's intent for interrupting. 

139
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,540
And he leaves it at that. 

140
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,670
That would be harmless venting, but how would we respond 

141
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,050
to John in either scenario But especially in the red 

142
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:44,150
flag scenario, we might say something like John, I share 

143
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,890
your concern about Mandy's interruptions that telling me isn't going 

144
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,850
to make it better. 

145
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,280
I think you need to talk to Mandy. 

146
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,530
I'm happy to help you think through how you could 

147
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,000
approach that conversation. 

148
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,630
Remember everyone, Vince, we're all human and we get under 

149
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,980
each other's skin. 

150
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,790
Yes, but there is a fine line between venting and 

151
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,510
gossiping. 

152
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:16,350
Once you stop stating facts and start making accusations and 

153
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,600
assumptions that we're venting can turn into gossiping. 

154
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:30,060
Unnecessary gossip creates many negative consequences and it can create 

155
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,640
a lot of commotion in the workplace. 

156
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,110
Some of the negative effects of gossip might be, of 

157
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,650
course, like I said before, it spreads like wildfire, right 

158
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,540
Rumors will circulate. 

159
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,960
And the truth becomes virtually unrecognizable. 

160
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,490
This negative effect of gossip could be that it results 

161
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,740
in a loss of productivity causes coworkers to choose upsides 

162
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,510
definitely will lower morale people lose trust in each other 

163
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,230
and turnover and hostile work environment issues become much more 

164
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,300
prevalent not to mention the fact that gossip is really 

165
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,610
a major drain on time and money. 

166
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,860
The actual cost of the weekly time spent gossiping in 

167
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,710
an average workplace can be very high. 

168
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,270
This wasted time is found on a consistent basis and 

169
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,530
comes in many forms. 

170
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,270
This drain on time and money could be in person 

171
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,150
at the office coffee machine or in whispers over a 

172
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,780
desk. 

173
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,310
When we should be working, it can be via direct 

174
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:46,590
messenger online again, when we should be working through email, 

175
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,790
when we should be working, you may use an app 

176
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,150
like WhatsApp, for instance, and you may have colleague groups, 

177
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:59,730
which can be very productive, but if not used properly 

178
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,590
and if used for gossip, WhatsApp, or signal or any 

179
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:10,080
of those other apps, including text messaging can be very 

180
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,140
destructive and text messaging while actually in the same room 

181
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,360
at the same meeting can be not only very disrespectful, 

182
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,280
but also very destructive. 

183
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,880
And it's, it tends to single the two or three 

184
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,690
people out who were in that text message group as 

185
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,920
being as against the rest of the crowd can be 

186
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,090
very divisive. 

187
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,830
And instead of learning something we should be taking seriously 

188
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,160
at that team meeting, we're just in our own little 

189
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:51,240
world, gossiping negative effects can also be very detrimental to 

190
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,040
the victim of gossip. 

191
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,800
People who we gossip about. 

192
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,370
In-depth oftentimes with a hurt reputation, maybe things have been 

193
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,570
said that are untrue. 

194
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,800
They sound juicy. 

195
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,350
And boy, are we ready to open our ears and 

196
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,620
listen, but is it true And if it is true, 

197
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,630
does it matter The victim of gossip may already be 

198
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,930
feeling terrible because if what you are saying is true, 

199
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,220
it could be very unflattering information and that person may 

200
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,380
not be happy to think about it. 

201
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,360
And it may be something they're struggling with. 

202
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,170
So knowing that other folks are gossiping around the office 

203
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,940
will continue to lower their self-esteem could possibly plunge them 

204
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,580
into a depression and increase anxiety. 

205
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,150
Sadly enough suicides have been committed over workplace gossip. 

206
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:52,540
Sometimes the workplace becomes like a playground at school and 

207
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,080
we know how brutal children can be with each other. 

208
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,060
They don't have the maturity oftentimes to make the decision 

209
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:05,890
that something is healthy or not healthy or acceptable or 

210
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:12,250
unacceptable in a social circle, sadly enough, sometimes adults don't 

211
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,300
have that ability, or I don't know, they just don't 

212
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,370
take the initiative to exercise the ability to make those 

213
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:28,420
same decisions and suicidal thoughts and actions may result. 

214
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:37,150
Gossip is ultimately divisive gossip, divides and conquers a workplace 

215
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,890
and not in a good way. 

216
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,110
We must take the power that gossip carries very seriously. 

217
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,420
The subject or the target of the gossip is an 

218
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,730
actual victim and harassment cases have shown this. 

219
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,020
This is not just the funny person that we're talking 

220
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,480
about or the person everybody thinks is ridiculous. 

221
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:06,370
Or did you hear what Sally did Saturday night Now 

222
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,970
this can actually turn into a harassment case and it 

223
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,650
is very serious participants eventually choose upsides. 

224
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:21,010
And the workplace becomes a battlefield gossip gone, wild can 

225
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,670
become slander, which may be illegal. 

226
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,220
So what are some situations that trigger gossip Why do 

227
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,890
we gossip Well, sometimes we gossip because it's the fear 

228
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,730
of the unknown. 

229
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,930
You know, humans are anxious people and you know, when 

230
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,810
people feel like they are being kept in the dark, 

231
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,810
this anxiety can manifest as gossip. 

232
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,650
Sometimes people gossip because they crave a sense of belonging. 

233
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,960
If someone believes they don't have information that the rest 

234
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,800
of the team has, they will feel excluded and not 

235
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,610
part of the team. 

236
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,800
And so they may gossip to become a part of 

237
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,780
a group that they feel left out of. 

238
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,940
Sometimes people gossip, just because they need to feel superior, 

239
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,450
they are envious, jealous, or they're just attention seeking people. 

240
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,460
If someone feels insecure, they'll often try to tear others 

241
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,760
down in the hope of making themselves feel better. 

242
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,980
Most gossipers honestly are pure attention seekers. 

243
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,910
Now I know we've all been gossipers. 

244
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,750
We've all done it. 

245
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,820
Nobody's without gossip, guilt. 

246
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,300
And where are we A pure attention seeker in that 

247
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,870
moment where we jealous, where we envious, where we needing 

248
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,600
to feel superior I don't know. 

249
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
I think that's a personal question. 

250
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,130
We all have to ask ourselves, but at the end 

251
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:02,220
of the day, if you are gossiping, your intentions were 

252
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,970
not pure. 

253
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,500
You know, because seeking to reach out and create a 

254
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,010
chain of help for someone in need is not gossip. 

255
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,550
So remember the difference, person may begin gossiping because they're 

256
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,450
angry. 

257
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,490
They may want to take revenge on someone who made 

258
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,410
them angry, who made them feel hurt. 

259
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:30,870
So one hot Goss can spawn another hot Goss. 

260
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,170
And before you know it, we're back to the battlefield 

261
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:35,940
and we're all angry. 

262
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,990
And then for some people, gossip is just a way 

263
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,160
of passing time. 

264
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,200
You know, I had a friend who we called the 

265
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,100
mouth of the south and she was just bored a 

266
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,550
lot. 

267
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:54,780
And her gossiping tendencies were usually the highest when she 

268
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,330
didn't have a lot of work to do at home 

269
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,220
or at the workplace. 

270
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,740
So employees must take accountability for their own free time 

271
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,940
and use it wisely. 

272
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,470
If we finish up an assignment quicker than we expected, 

273
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,230
or maybe we're having a slow day in the workplace, 

274
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,360
not many customers are coming through. 

275
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:17,610
Seems like there's not a lot to do. 

276
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,780
And we're a little bored. 

277
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,340
Well, let's grab a broom or, you know, reorganize a 

278
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:30,900
desk or something to avoid ourselves from falling into a 

279
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,420
big gossip party, just because we're bored. 

280
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,730
Let's look at a case study. 

281
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,410
Sally has missed a week of work unexpectedly. 

282
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,040
She has been an employee of Acme for 10 years 

283
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,720
and rarely misses work. 

284
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,650
This has been hard for the team because Sally not 

285
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,310
there to support them through a huge inspection that they 

286
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,310
have been anticipating for months. 

287
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,790
Here are some examples of the gossip that could spread 

288
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,470
about Sally missing work. 

289
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,790
Sally has COVID because I heard her sneeze the last 

290
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,780
day she was here. 

291
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,750
Sally was pulled into the office. 

292
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,190
I bet she got fired. 

293
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,750
I heard Sally on the phone with her husband talking 

294
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,610
about planning a trip to the beach. 

295
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,820
I bet she missed work to avoid the inspection. 

296
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,000
Sally said her grandma was sick. 

297
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,080
I think she died. 

298
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,400
Is all of this gossip negative Well, maybe not. 

299
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,790
I mean, Sally, having a grandmother who was sick and 

300
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,770
dying, that's not negative. 

301
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:42,340
It may not be true that it's not harmful to 

302
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,970
Sally. 

303
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,650
If that's the end of it, Sally has COVID. 

304
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,760
That can be harmful. 

305
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,880
It can also be a caring comment. 

306
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,900
I'm worried about her. 

307
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,390
I hope she doesn't have COVID but still at the 

308
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,760
end of the day, we don't know what's happened with 

309
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,170
Sally and it's gossip. 

310
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,280
Certainly something like Sally getting fired or conspiring to avoid 

311
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,960
the inspection that has been on everybody's minds for months. 

312
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,740
That's certainly going to be harmful negative gossip. 

313
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,880
Why don't we just stay away from the conversation altogether, 

314
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:25,240
changing the subject and keeping it positive is one really 

315
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,650
great way to combat gossip in the workplace. 

316
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,650
So why don't we just redirect the conversation When you 

317
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,700
hear gossip starting up, take control of the conversation at 

318
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,930
the onset of the gossip center, your conversations on positive 

319
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,860
topics, change the subject to work topics that don't include. 

320
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,210
Other people take a personal interest in the other person. 

321
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,460
People love to talk about themselves. 

322
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,790
For example, ask what the person's plans are for the 

323
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,770
weekend or what they're having for dinner. 

324
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,190
People are less likely to want to gossip with you 

325
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,350
if you're not engaging in the gossip. 

326
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,340
So don't contribute any negative stories and don't respond to 

327
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:09,820
anyone. 

328
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,000
Else's hints that they have gossip to share. 

329
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,640
Know when to walk away. 

330
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,050
Some people will not get the hint by swiftly changing 

331
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:20,680
the subject. 

332
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,010
You may just need to kindly excuse yourself from the 

333
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,070
conversation and let the person know that you don't want 

334
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,960
to engage in the subject, or you could encourage positive 

335
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,500
gossip. 

336
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,760
You can easily spoil someone's attempt to gossip in a 

337
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,930
negative fashion. 

338
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,080
I simply paying a compliment to the person they're trying 

339
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,250
to gossip about. 

340
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,380
Here's a case study. 

341
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,310
Meredith was having a snack, the break room with Bailey. 

342
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,630
Alex walks in to get coffee ranting about how Christina 

343
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,320
is so bossy and has no respect for her coworkers. 

344
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,980
She steals credit for my ideas and always steps in 

345
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,110
front of me for the prime projects. 

346
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,070
He complains Meredith tries to talk him down. 

347
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:12,010
She says, yes, Christina is bossy, but she's very talented. 

348
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,510
Bailey interrupts and says, Hey, Alex, I really liked the 

349
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,130
way you handled that Jones case. 

350
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,420
Last week, Mr. 

351
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,610
Jones can be Taft, but you really took care of 

352
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:28,210
his concerns, Alex smirks and says, yeah, thanks. 

353
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,320
He was tough. 

354
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,010
Aly interrupts and says, yes, but you were tougher. 

355
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,050
Alex says, I guess, and leaves the break room. 

356
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,370
If you're working in a group, this would be a 

357
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,900
great time to stop the video and evaluate both Meredith 

358
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:52,240
and Bailey who did the best job and why, if 

359
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,360
you're working alone, you can still stop the video and 

360
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:03,980
think it through confidentiality, everything is not everyone's business. 

361
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,300
So even when you're talking about yourself, believe it or 

362
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,340
not people gossip about themselves. 

363
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,720
Yeah. 

364
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,440
It's true. 

365
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,080
Have you ever heard of TMI too much information So 

366
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,450
avoid oversharing your personal details, because maybe you want people 

367
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,320
to talk about you. 

368
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,080
Maybe that is your version of attention seeking. 

369
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,900
Have you ever known someone like that who will talk 

370
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:36,170
about themselves and basically hope you spread the message, things 

371
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:41,120
like personal finances, of course, negative feelings about coworkers that 

372
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,790
you have, religion, politics, health issues, dating, or your love 

373
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,380
life in general activities that you do outside of work. 

374
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,030
Some of these things in, in moderation are, are fine, 

375
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:02,090
but oversharing is when it really becomes a burden on 

376
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,170
the other individual. 

377
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,990
And maybe the other individual's burden is they just don't 

378
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,380
care. 

379
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:09,590
They don't want to hear TMI, stop talking about yourself 

380
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,730
all the time, or maybe it's a burden for them 

381
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,960
to hold back from then repeating what you've told them. 

382
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,400
Either way. 

383
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,210
Don't give people more than they can bear, right Sharing 

384
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:26,000
too much private information about your life feelings about your 

385
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,350
coworkers and other sensitive subjects can be a breeding ground 

386
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,690
for gossip to occur about you. 

387
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,120
So to share or not to share, ask yourself a 

388
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,990
few questions. 

389
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,540
What is my intention with sharing this information Can the 

390
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,760
information someone, or can it hurt me And how would 

391
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,880
I feel if this information were to be spread around 

392
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,170
the office And you might also add on how would 

393
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:03,200
I feel when it's known I was the source of 

394
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,190
this information. 

395
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:09,980
When a conversation is none of your business closed door 

396
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,080
meetings should be your first clue. 

397
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,810
When people go behind a closed door, that is usually 

398
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,360
a signal to the world that this is a private 

399
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,770
conversation that's happening. 

400
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,950
So if you're behind the door in the middle of 

401
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,660
the conversation, understand that this is a private discussion. 

402
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,170
And if you are on the other side of the 

403
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,750
door, looking in, or trying to listen in, understand that 

404
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,050
the closed door should be your first clue, that this 

405
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,170
is none of your business, the door's closed because people 

406
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,130
want privacy. 

407
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:50,660
Therefore speculating on the conversation behind the door can only 

408
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:56,000
lead to gossip and misinformation pressuring. 

409
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,480
One of the participants to spill the tea is also 

410
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,140
inappropriate conversations between HR and an employee management and an 

411
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:12,500
employee or HR and management should remain confidential and are 

412
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,610
not the business of anyone who is not in the 

413
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,210
room. 

414
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:23,330
When the conversation took place, let's look at a case 

415
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:29,510
steady Pat's supervisor, Kay has called a meeting to discuss 

416
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,200
the fact that a coworker has been diagnosed with COVID-19. 

417
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,020
And pat was one of the people in the building 

418
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,830
who has been exposed pat and K chat for a 

419
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,550
few minutes. 

420
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,520
And then pat clocks out and prepares to go home 

421
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,100
while gathering her things. 

422
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,110
Pat, who is visibly shaken is approached by Monroe, who 

423
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,770
asks, why she's leaving so early in the day, what 

424
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,240
happened in there Did you get fired Monroe asked pressuring 

425
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:05,570
pat for answers, pat breaks and begins to cry saying 

426
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,960
she's probably got COVID and she leaves in a hurry. 

427
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:16,670
Monroe is now armed with a big decision, be the 

428
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,360
hot Goss king, and try to find out if anyone 

429
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,770
else has COVID or say nothing, realizing he does not 

430
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,330
have all the facts has clearly overstepped with pat and 

431
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,770
should now show compassion. 

432
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,490
This is gut check time. 

433
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,020
What would you do if you were in Monroe's position, 

434
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,700
stop the video and discuss, or think it through on 

435
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,740
your own hopping off of the gossip bandwagon. 

436
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,430
It's pretty easy to hop on the bandwagon when gossip 

437
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:56,850
is around that hopping off is a different story. 

438
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,160
Once we've already become involved. 

439
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,380
So think before you speak, put yourself in the other 

440
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,550
person's shoes, don't say anything that you would not want 

441
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,450
anyone saying about you and avoid putting yourself in the 

442
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,610
position to gossip in the first place. 

443
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,410
If you find that that's where you've landed, steer conversations 

444
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:25,170
away from gossip and move them back to more productive 

445
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,980
discussions, like something on a project that not the gossip 

446
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,000
hop off. 

447
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,650
The bandwagon questions to ask yourself to avoid boss up 

448
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,590
are, is what I'm about to say. 

449
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,160
True. 

450
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,350
Is it harmless Is it necessary How would I feel 

451
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,390
if someone said something similar about me, how would I 

452
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,000
feel if I saw my words quoted in the daily 

453
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,500
paper tomorrow How am I going to feel later if 

454
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,590
I say this, or maybe even listen to this, does 

455
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,410
gossiping honor my own personal values. 

456
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,480
As the conversation take pleasure in the misfortune of others, 

457
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,960
does this conversation have a negative emotional charge or seem 

458
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:26,470
to perpetuate conflict or negativity Is this conversation hurt or 

459
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,210
damage the reputation of others What I say these things 

460
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,590
to the person's face. 

461
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,930
And should I be saying these things to the person 

462
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:44,460
instead of behind their back, it's always a good idea 

463
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,010
to step back and ask yourself these questions. 

464
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:51,720
When you're tempted to participate in rumors or gossip, and 

465
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,650
remember simply hanging out and listening to gossip makes you 

466
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,550
a part of the conversation, whether or not you ever 

467
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:06,420
open your mouth guilty by association. 

468
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,190
Some might say that in order to truly avoid gossip, 

469
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:20,820
we must truly avoid gossip, section two management, confidentiality, what 

470
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,910
to share and what not to share with your employees 

471
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:32,820
closed door conversations with HR can be very intriguing to 

472
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,410
the people on the other side of the door. 

473
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:42,580
So remember this, unless otherwise stated all conversations with HR 

474
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:48,010
are considered to be confidential and are not to be 

475
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,660
shared with anyone. 

476
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,180
Management must accept the fact that they do not have 

477
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,170
a need to know regarding all conversations about employees and 

478
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,830
their department. 

479
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,230
Some conversations between employees and HR will not be shared 

480
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:10,960
with managers and supervisors, managers, and supervisors don't like this 

481
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,390
because they feel like they have a need to know. 

482
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,840
This is not always the case. 

483
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,350
Some confidential employee information comes in the version of, you 

484
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,340
know, paperwork. 

485
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,820
So maybe social security numbers, date of birth, marital status, 

486
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,720
mailing address. 

487
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,690
Those may be some things that are confidential. 

488
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,520
Job application data like resume background checks and interview notes 

489
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,150
may also find themselves in a confidential file, depending upon 

490
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:45,100
what is written nines and tax forms, workers' comp and 

491
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:50,320
FMLA claims any sort of employee medical information, including a 

492
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,040
positive COVID test are all considered confidential and job termination 

493
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,430
data. 

494
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:03,130
The employee's resignation letter, termination records and unemployment insurance claims. 

495
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,260
This is all confidential. 

496
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:14,080
HR information managers and supervisors must maintain confidentiality in many 

497
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,190
areas as well. 

498
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:23,710
Discussions about employee relations issues, disciplinary actions, impending, layoffs, or 

499
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,770
reductions in force terminations. 

500
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:35,170
These are all very highly confidential workplace investigations over employee 

501
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,250
misconduct. 

502
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:41,530
Again, highly confidential, not to be shared, definitely the makings 

503
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:46,480
of some good hot GOs that confidential do not share 

504
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:53,560
ADA or EEOC issues, FMLA or other leave requests, employee 

505
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,720
illnesses, even the most simple or obvious conditions like a 

506
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,570
pregnancy for instance, should not be discussed in the workplace 

507
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,430
between managers, supervisors, and staff. 

508
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,140
Corporate email can be dangerous and feeding gossip. 

509
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,880
So be careful information via email can be easily forward 

510
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,530
to unauthorized eyes. 

511
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,140
So when you have something that is confidential, be careful 

512
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,140
what you say in email and who you say it 

513
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:29,530
to. 

514
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:36,730
So how would we address employee questions about confidential information 

515
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,150
This comes up a lot in our managers and supervisors, 

516
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,730
along with HR, all battle. 

517
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,640
These questions that come from sources who don't have a 

518
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,880
need to know managers must strive to answer questions with 

519
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,590
the utmost professionalism. 

520
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,590
Sometimes a more serious approach is needed. 

521
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,100
When questions are asked that are obviously intended for the 

522
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,860
gossip mill or some sort of personal agenda. 

523
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,160
Even when a question is asked with the best of 

524
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:11,530
intentions, some things are just not the business of others. 

525
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:17,230
And as managers, there could be legal consequences for overstepping 

526
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,280
boundaries. 

527
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:24,970
For example, when someone asks, which coworker exposed me to 

528
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,040
COVID, you might say something like, I cannot disclose that 

529
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:30,820
information. 

530
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,890
I'm sure if the person wants you to know, they 

531
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:36,730
will tell you now, does that sound a little flippant 

532
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,420
Maybe depending upon the tone you use, but you can 

533
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,420
say it kindly, but it is very clear. 

534
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,240
It lets them know that you're not going to disclose 

535
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,140
this information. 

536
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,470
Why is Sally out for a week Is she sick 

537
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,740
Did she get fired Well, I'm sure if Sally wants 

538
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,880
you to know, then she'll tell you, you know, something 

539
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,270
along those lines, you don't want to say, well, she's 

540
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,650
not sick and she didn't get fired. 

541
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,530
Well, what is it Then You know, don't let them 

542
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,840
lead you down the path of 20 questions. 

543
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,020
I'm sure if Sally wants you to know, then she'll 

544
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:15,640
tell you, Fred told me that John got into trouble 

545
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,120
yesterday. 

546
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,620
What did he do I'm not sure what you hope 

547
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,780
to gain by asking this question. 

548
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,800
You should not encourage Fred or anyone else to spread 

549
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,340
gossip. 

550
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,790
That's a very direct way to answer that question, but 

551
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,030
you can also say it kindly, but it is professional. 

552
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,810
Is it true that Billy got the black eye from 

553
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,850
her spouse I'm not sure what relevance this topic has 

554
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,410
to your position with our company. 

555
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,640
Is there anything else I can assist you with Sometimes 

556
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,420
you just have to face the most brutal questions that 

557
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:59,280
are obviously meant for gossip with a very stern answer. 

558
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,150
This might be a good time to stop the video 

559
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,300
in a group setting and discuss some of the questions 

560
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,330
that have come up in your departments and how you've 

561
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,270
handled them and maybe how you can handle them differently. 

562
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:18,430
Next time gossip and section seven of the N L 

563
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,450
R a. 

564
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,320
What is the NLRA Well, it stands for national labor 

565
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,670
relations act. 

566
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,440
Employers are encouraged to have no gossip policies. 

567
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,220
Legal counsel should be consulted to be sure that the 

568
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,520
language does not violate the NLRA 'cause section seven of 

569
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,610
the NLRA says employees shall have the right to self-organize 

570
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:52,530
to form join or assist labor organizations to bargain collectively 

571
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:57,330
through representatives of their own choosing and to engage in 

572
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:02,700
other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or 

573
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,520
other mutual aid or protection. 

574
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,190
So section seven basically provides that employees have the right 

575
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,300
to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of mutual 

576
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:21,660
aid or protection section seven rights belong to non-supervisory employees 

577
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,740
in all types of workplaces, including those that do not 

578
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,760
have unions. 

579
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,240
Section seven does not however, apply to governmental employees at 

580
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,400
the federal or state levels. 

581
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:42,420
So here we're talking about private sector under the NLRA. 

582
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,100
Your no gossip policy will be unlawful or illegal. 

583
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:53,220
If it directly restricts employees from exercising, their section seven 

584
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,920
rights or employees would reasonably construe the language in the 

585
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,970
policy to prohibit section seven protected activity, or the policy 

586
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:11,940
was implemented in response to union activity, or the policy 

587
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,080
has been applied to restrict section seven activity. 

588
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:23,220
In recent years, the NLRA ordered employers to resend no 

589
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,360
gossip policies on the basis that the policies could be 

590
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,400
construed to prohibit employees from discussing the terms and conditions 

591
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,670
of their employment with other employees. 

592
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:42,960
The bottom line non-supervisory employees cannot be barred from discussing 

593
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:51,360
or complaining about working conditions, safety, wages, management, or unlawful 

594
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,970
conduct, best practices for creating compliant. 

595
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:02,160
No gossip policies might be to determine whether to take 

596
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,450
action steps, to try and limit gossip in the workplace, 

597
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,300
develop a policy that your organization is comfortable with in 

598
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,690
terms of the parameters established by the NLRB decisions and 

599
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,910
other applicable laws. 

600
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,860
Now, remember I mentioned the national labor relations act, which 

601
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,630
is then governed by the national labor relations board, which 

602
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:37,540
is the NLRB implement the policy throughout employee discussions and 

603
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,800
training on acceptable versus unacceptable behavior. 

604
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:49,540
Take adverse action against employees only after a thorough investigation, 

605
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:55,630
take adverse action against employees only after giving them the 

606
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:02,080
right to explain their behavior and take adverse action against 

607
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,150
employees under the policy. 

608
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:11,860
Only after considering recent NLRB decisions, setting parameters to apply 

609
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:17,650
to no gossip policies, make the subject of respect in 

610
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,940
the workplace, a source of discussion on a regular basis. 

611
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,000
And remember always consult legal counsel before implementing a no 

612
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,650
gossip policy. 

613
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:36,730
Every manager has responsibility in the workplace to make employees 

614
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,900
feel safe. 

615
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:45,730
Gossip can be a very threatening tool, used to make 

616
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:50,320
coworkers feel unsafe in the workplace. 

617
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,580
So what's a manager to do well. 

618
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,440
Address the gossipers. 

619
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,160
Don't be a part of the gossip address them, make 

620
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,050
sure this is done in confidence. 

621
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,810
So others cannot hear what is being discussed. 

622
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,320
Talk to the person and try to understand what is 

623
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,730
motivating them to spread boss it about another employee. 

624
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:16,600
In some cases, there might be an underlying issue that 

625
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,770
needs to be addressed. 

626
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,170
Your end goal should be to help the person understand 

627
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:27,700
the impact of their behavior and the consequences of what 

628
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,420
will happen. 

629
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,750
If it continues, take necessary action. 

630
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,920
If a discussion with the gossiper has not put an 

631
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,460
in to the behavior, then it's time to take action. 

632
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,880
Managers should start with a verbal warning. 

633
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,480
Then a formal written warning for the employee's file. 

634
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,950
If HR has not created a policy about gossip, they 

635
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,690
should be encouraged to do so. 

636
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,650
Finally be the example don't get caught up in the 

637
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,700
rumor mill employees will try to feed you gossip about 

638
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:02,320
others for their own benefit. 

639
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,150
Your job is to stop the gossip in its tracks. 

640
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:14,830
One toxic person can drive your good employees away, especially 

641
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:18,880
if they see that their behavior is going an addressed. 

642
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,690
So if you want to keep your good faithful, loyal, 

643
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:31,140
solid employees handle the gossip, stop it before it takes 

644
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:31,770
root
